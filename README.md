# raspberryPi-TrafficLightControls

Welcome to the RaspberryPi-TrafficLightControls project! This project was developed as part of the Computer Science 311 Networking Module at the University of the Western Cape with my team consisting of 10 members.

Overview: 
The RaspberryPi-TrafficLightControls project aims to provide a practical implementation of traffic light control using a Raspberry Pi. This project explores networking concepts and their application in controlling traffic lights, simulating a real-world scenario.

Features: 
Traffic Light Control: Control the behavior of traffic lights using a Raspberry Pi.
Networking Integration: Utilize networking principles to coordinate traffic light operations.
Simulation: Simulate traffic flow and light changes to test different scenarios.

Setup: 
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Hardware Setup: Connect your Raspberry Pi to the required components, such as LEDs for traffic lights.
Software Installation: Install the necessary software packages on your Raspberry Pi.
Configuration: Configure the network settings and traffic light behavior according to your requirements.
Run the Program: Execute the main program to start controlling the traffic lights.
Usage
Once the setup is complete, you can interact with the traffic lights through the provided interface. Experiment with different configurations and observe how networking principles influence traffic flow.
